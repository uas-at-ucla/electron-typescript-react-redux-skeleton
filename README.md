This project can be used as a starting point for building an Electron application with Typescript, React, and Redux, with many useful things already configured, such as linting for VS Code. Get started by clicking "Use this template" above, or copying files as needed.

Included are basic examples of core functionalities often used in React-Redux apps, as well as an example of using custom middleware to connect your app to a communication socket, and accessing the filesystem with Electron.

Additionally, GitHub Actions is used to automatically create releases with the packaged Electron app (at https://github.com/uas-at-ucla/electron-typescript-react-redux-skeleton/releases) and deploy the web app to GitHub Pages (at https://uas-at-ucla.github.io/electron-typescript-react-redux-skeleton/). Depending on your goals, you may just want one or the other.
