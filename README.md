This project can be used as a starting point for building an Electron application with Typescript, React, and Redux, with many useful things already configured, such as linting for VS Code.

It includes basic examples of core functionalities that are usually involved in React-Redux apps, as well as an example of using custom middleware to connect your app to a communication socket.
